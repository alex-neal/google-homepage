# google-homepage

This is a non-functioning replica of the google homepage that I built as an exercise in creating HTML/CSS layouts. All coding was done by hand, and Google's source code was not used as reference.

To view the result, download this repository and open the file 'google.html' in your web browser.

I completed this as assigned by The Odin Project. Instructions can be found here: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css
